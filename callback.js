//how js executes its code
//execution context 
// 1==> global execution context (it is located in THIS)
// 2==> functional execution context 
// 3==> Eval execution context

// 2 phases
// 1.Memory creation phase
// 2. execution phase

// steps

// 1----> GEC store in THIS

//2---->  Memory Phase(in this phase all variables names are stored and its value is  undefined,  the value of the function is its defination).

//3--->  Execution phase (in this phase variables have given there values which is given in the code)

//when a function is called again two pahses are made memory creation phase and execution phase

//after completely execute the code GEC gets deleted


//call stack

// it is a stack which store the methods and remove after execution it follows LIFI .
